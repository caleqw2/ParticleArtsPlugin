# ParticleArtsPlugin ðŸŽµ

ParticleArtsPlugin is a VST3 plugin built with [**JUCE**](https://juce.com) that provides an interesting new way to randomize MIDI signals in music production: *particle physics!*

When running the plugin, input signals from an external MIDI device become bouncing 2-D particles with matching pitch and initial velocity. When particles collide, their respective pitches are output as MIDI signals with velocities corresponding to their pre-collision momentum.

Route these output MIDI signals to any MIDI software instrument for a cool randomized effect!

## Some tips:

- I've found that adding a delay effect on top of any synth patch creates cool sounds.
- For best results, stick to a small amount of consonant notes (try only 1, 2, 5). Less is more!
- The "Add Ball" button randomly adds a note in a subset of C's, D's, and G's.
- I've added a velocity slider to control overall particle speed.
